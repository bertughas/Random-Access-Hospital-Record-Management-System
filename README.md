Random Access Hospital Record Management System

This is a simple hospital record management system implemented in C. It allows basic operations such as adding patients, listing patients, deleting patients, updating patient information, and creating a patient list. The system utilizes file I/O to store patient data persistently.

Features:

- Create List (Reset): Initialize a new patient database, clearing any existing data.
- Add Patient: Add a new patient to the system with a unique ID, name, age, and illness information.
- Find Patient: Search for a patient in the database based on their ID and display their information.
- Delete Patient: Remove a patient from the system based on their ID.
- Update Patient Record: Modify the information of an existing patient in the database.
- List Patients: Display a list of all existing patients along with their information.

Usage:

1. Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the on-screen menu to perform various operations.
